# GitLab-s-CI-CD-Functions
Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all the code that is being produced by developers.
The merging usually takes place several times a day in a shared repository. From within the repository, or production environment, building and automated testing are carried out that ensure no integration issues and the early identification of any problems.  
Continuous Delivery adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system.   Continuous Deployment goes further and pushes changes to production automatically.

CI/CD at GitLab

Continuous Integration (CI) works to integrate code provided by your team in a shared repository. Developers share the new code in a Merge (Pull) Request. The request triggers a pipeline to build, test, and validate the new code prior to merging the changes within your repository.

The practice of Continuous Delivery (CD) ensures the delivery of CI validated code to your application by means of a structured deployment pipeline.

Together, CI and CD act to accelerate how quickly your team can deliver results for your customers and stakeholders. CI helps you catch and reduce bugs early in the development cycle, and CD moves verified code to your applications faster.

CI and CD must work seamlessly together in order for your team to build fast and effectively, as well as being critical to ensuring a fully optimized development practice. GitLab CI/CD is rated #1 in the Forrester CI Waveâ„¢

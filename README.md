Continuous Integration is the practice of merging all the code that is being produced by developers. The merging usually takes place several times a day in a shared repository. From within the repository, or production environment, building and automated testing are carried out that ensure no integration issues and the early identification of any problems.    Continuous Delivery adds that the software can be released to production at any time, often by automatically pushing changes to a staging system.   Continuous Deployment goes further and pushes changes to production automatically.
